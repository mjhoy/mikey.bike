BUILDING

  bin/build: requires nix and cabal2nix, will (supposedly) set up
  everything just right. there's a bit of hackery to add in a
  dependency on Cocoa if you're on osx, which I need for some reason.

  on osx:

  $ nix-shell --command "cabal build" shell-osx.nix


DEVELOPMENT

  bin/preview: runs a local server on port 8000 (standard hakyll site
  setup)


DEPLOY

  bin/deploy: a simple rsync up to my server
