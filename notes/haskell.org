* Haskell

** Setup

For a long time I used nix, but I've found a nix install often breaks
with OS X updates and requires a certain amount of care to maintain.

The good news is that =ghcup= just works. Follow the instructions at
https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/, then it's just a simple

#+begin_src sh
ghcup install ghc 8.10.3
#+end_src
