      I am a software engineer with three years experience writing
      well-tested, maintainable software, and four years experience as a web
      developer in close collaboration with a graphic designer. I love
      building new features, fast iterations, finding useful abstractions,
      and collaborating with product and design. I’m drawn to work
      environments where I’m always learning new things.

        I joined the Freebird engineering team in 2018. Our work was focused
        on developing Freebird’s rebooking product, powered by a Rails app
        and a suite of Scala microservices to interface with various airline
        systems. As part of a small team, I collaborated closely with both
        product and design to build out features.

      <p>
        Cofounders Paul and Alex Berg hired me as part of their nascent
        startup to develop rentable.com, an online rental marketplace. My
        responsibilities included Stripe integration, migrating from MySQL to
        Postgres, integration testing between our API endpoints, implementing
        a web scraping algorithm, and front-end design. Our codebase was
        entirely written in PureScript, and I left feeling convinced of the
        benefits in using common datatypes and functions shared between
        frontend and backend code in a strongly-typed language: easier
        refactoring, easier code review, and less bugs.
