    <p>
      I have six years of experience writing well-tested, maintainable
      software with small engineering teams. I love collaboration,
      building useful abstractions, and developing a culture of
      engineering best practices. I’m drawn to work environments where
      I’m always learning new things.

        I joined Sagewell’s small engineering team to help build their

        collaborated closely with both product and design to build out
        features.
