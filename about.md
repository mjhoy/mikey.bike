title: About this site
---

Hi! I'm Mikey Hoy, a software engineer in Somerville,
Massachusetts. This is my blog that is now mostly not about biking. I
[used to][writings] write more about biking.

This site is generated using some code built around the [Hakyll]
framework. It's available at [github.com/mjhoy/mikey.bike].

The monospace font used is ["Monaspace Neon"][monaspace].

You can email me at mjh@&lt;my github handle&gt;.com.
