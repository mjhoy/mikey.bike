title: About this site
---

Hi! I'm Mikey Hoy, a software engineer in Somerville, Massachusetts. This is my
blog, which used to be [mostly about my bike trips][writings] and now it is
not. üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This site is generated with some code built around the [Hakyll] framework. It's
available at [github.com/mjhoy/mikey.bike]. An RSS feed is available
[here][rss].

The monospace font used is ["Monaspace Neon"][monaspace].

You can email me at mjh@&lt;my github handle&gt;.com.
