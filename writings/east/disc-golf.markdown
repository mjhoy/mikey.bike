“Shit.”<br>
“Nice toss.”<br>
“It’s coming around.”<br>
“No it isn’t.”<br>
“Get back there!”<br>
“It’s not coming back.”

The disc that shot like a bullet from the hand of Michael Jordan made like it
would bank slightly to the left — all of us felt this intuitively — but instead it
continued on a straight path and landed thirty yards from hole 1, in a patch of
trees and mud. According to the group of men playing disc golf at 4pm on
Memorial Day — Ben, Adam, Chris, and Mike — this was a throw that could have
been better. To me it was astounding how well the piece of plastic was thrown.
Mike might have been frustrated, but he broke into a warm chuckle and stood
way for the next golfer.

My own throw was miserable, and the group commiserated. “I’ve done that a
million times.” “Better than most for their first try.” “Not too bad!” They were
a supportive bunch. I was out in the woods and the muck, looking for a disc. It
was the first sunny day in weeks of rain. My disc golfing companions had all
partied hard last night (for at least fifteen hours), but today they would not
miss the nice weather. Although everyone I met had a severe hangover, they would
have been “banging chains” on hole 18 while I was stuck on 6, had they not been
waiting for me.

“I love disc golf. You get frustrated like nothing else, but then remember
you’re outside with friends, drinking beer.”

“God dammit, I shouldn’a worn my disc golfing shoes.”

Disc golfing is, I learned that day, a thing. And like all things, it can be
monetized, and it is. There are disc golfing shoes, and disc golfing bags
designed to hold disc golfing discs. There are special, very small discs to drop
down and mark your place. I suppose it is a little like golf, although I am disc
golfing in the Maine woods — what feel like old logging roads — in the swamp,
with good-natured golfers who swear like sailors, drink beer and smoke pot on
the course. Still, there is a maintained level of seriousness. Many golfers
shuffle around with a staggering number of discs, and there is some ceremony in
approaching a new hole, putting down the bags, selecting the proper driver.

“A driver is heavy. You fling it and it’ll move. Use the putter for short
distances, for finesse.”

Ben has selected for me a driver called the “Wraith”. According to
innovadiscs.com, the Wraith is a distance driver, suitable for “long hyzers,
tailwind drives, long distance with great control.” It “performs predictably in
the wind.” It performs predictably for me: nearly every throw goes into the
woods. It is impossible for me to throw backhand. I am used to throwing a
frisbee, and this is quite different.

“Just think of a two-by-four level across your arms, and you have to move the
frisbee over it.”

One option for the less-skilled disc golfer is the “tomahawk” throw. Hold
the disc vertically, firmly between thumb and forefinger, and fling it hard
over the head. It will swoop and dance but stay straight. It’s a good throw to
get out of the trees, too.

“Nice out!”

Ben has arms that are the size of my head. I wouldn’t be surprised if they
balanced a scale with the gear I am packing on my Nishiki road bicycle, around
45 pounds.  Including me and my gear, the bike hauls less than 200 pounds — not
much more than your average American’s weight.

I had pulled into Ben’s driveway Monday afternoon, when the party from last
night was still dying down, and just before everyone decided to go play disc
golf. Ben’s an old friend from high school. He had agreed to host me after the
first day of my trip, and I was visiting for the first time in a long time. He
had bought a house and carved out a life for himself, here in Chesterville,
Maine, near Farmington.

(I was not in Quebec where I planned to be. This was central Maine. I decided,
last minute, to change my route, and head through New Hampshire and the White
Mountains.)

I noticed quite a few flags flying that day, around towns, around cemeteries.
Of one cemetery I ventured into, at least half of the gravestones had a veteran
badge with flags flying. I realized many of Ben’s friends I met that day had
served in the military. Maine is ranked first of states for military
recruitment per capita. It is also ranked first — by a wide margin — in deaths
per capita from the war in Afghanistan. In the little town of Madison I was
stopped on my way by a Memorial day parade, which, as a parade, to an outsider,
was a little pathetic. But the cheers for the marching recruits and veterans
were heartfelt and authentic, a small town supporting its own.
