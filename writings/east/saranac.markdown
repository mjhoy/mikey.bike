There are trees downed everywhere. Tall white birch, littering the forest of
younger white and yellow birch. They are strewn in the same general direction;
although which direction we aren’t sure. The sun hasn’t been out all day and
we don’t have a compass.

“You’ll be able to tell what kind of storm it was from the direction of the
blowdowns.”

Kate is my host for the day in the Adirondacks. She is taking me hiking. We hike
St. Regis Mountain in a cloud. My crocs inhale mud.

“These younger trees look 15 or 20 years old. There must have been a storm about
that long ago. This is all new growth to fill the opened canopy.”

We stop in front of an old yellow birch that appears to have multiple trunks
emerging from the same point in the ground. Kate tells me about coppicing, and
how you can date coppiced trees to learn about when the area was
forested. These trees are old. The protected forest preserve is old.

We swat our way through the mosquitoes. Kate points out pillows and cradles;
mounds and depressions throughout the forest. They indicate a blowdown long ago.
The root ball has decomposed into the pillow. When the tree falls, it tears dirt
from the ground, creating the cradle. The orientation of the pillow and cradle
suggests the direction the tree fell.

Fallen trees make other signs as well. Dead trees are a wonderful place for new
trees to grow. They grow in a straight line, on these “nurse logs.” Trees
growing on dead trees form roots above the soil, moving down over the fallen
log. They have “tent roots.” Kate suggests I read _Reading the Forested
Landscape_ by Tom Wessel. My notebook is filling up with book recommendations.

I stay in Saranac Lake for several days with my friend Andy, alternately waiting
out the rain and hiking. Hiking feels good on the legs after so much biking.
Along with St. Regis, I hike Baker and one of the Haystacks (there are as many
as three with that name here) with Andy.

On the trail we talk about the N.S.A., Edward Snowden, and Andy’s uranium coffee
mug.

“What is it, exactly?”<br>
“It’s a coffee mug, with a uranium glazing.”<br>
“Can I use it?”<br>
“No, it’s radioactive!”<br>
“What’s the point, then?”<br>
“It’s interesting. It’s a relic of the atomic era.”

In the archives of the Saranac Lake Free Library I find a collection of old
elementary school lunch menus, handwritten, each menu accompanied by an
illustration. The collection is introduced, “The Menues reflect what ever was
happening, or did happen on that day or time.” For instance, on Thursday, April
1, 1965, the school ate _Tomato Soup, Minced Ham Sandwich, Cottage Cheese, Milk,
Apple Betty_. There was a baseball game, a batter preparing his swing. On
Tuesday, May 11, 1965, it was _Tomato Rice Soup, Cold Meat Sandwich, Olives and
Pickles, Milk, Sliced Peaches_. A car sits outside an apartment, no note as to
whatever this meant. I remember Sliced Peaches from my school days, too.

On Monday, June 6, 1966, the meal was _Chicken Noodle Soup, Bologna Sandwich,
Green Bean Salad, Milk, Pineapple Tidbits_. Gemini 9 was splashing down.

The librarian tells me it was the school janitor who, every day, drew the
menus.

“He didn’t know, but his wife saved every one of them. When he died she had
boxes full.”

There are photographs of the town from the 1920s, when it was larger and
seemingly healthier. Saranac Lake was a destination for tuberculosis patients,
to rest and heal in the fresh mountain air. In one panorama, the hills are
dotted with hotels and cottages, each with porches dedicated for patients. A
train used to run here (technically it still does, but as a much-shortened
tourist train) bringing patients from the city.

“A lot of folks came to town just for a short time, and left on the train — some
of them bodies. And some liked it and stayed, and are still here, in their
eighties.”
