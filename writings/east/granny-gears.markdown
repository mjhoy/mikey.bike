A sign for a bike shop catches my eye and I pull off route 117 in Norway, Maine.
The morning sun beats down and I am already covered in sweat. The hospitable
shop owner offers water and use of his bathroom, both of which I don't need but
appreciate the gesture. I ask about installing a climbing sprocket. I am worried
about tackling the Kancamagus pass in the White Mountains without one. My low
gear is bad enough in the low hills of western Maine. The owner takes a look at
the chainrings.

“Well, I don’t have the parts here. We’re a new shop, not really prepared for
things like this. You can check out a bike shop in Conway.”

There are four bike shops near Conway, New Hampshire, and he tells me his
favorite. He asks about the chain. I tell him it’s new. He asks if it slips at
all on the freewheel. I tell him it doesn’t.

“I’d say, if it ain’t broke — if your chain isn’t slipping and it’s new, you can
count yourself lucky. You might have trouble with a new crankset. Your bike
looks pretty good, I would say you can handle the mountains, it might be a
little tough but you can do it.”

This is just the sort of advice I like to hear — what I’ve got will work just
fine, no need to buy more stuff. I decide then not to get a “granny gear” for
the Kanc.

There is a part of 117 that goes over a small mountain. A road sign at
the base announces the name of the road has changed, “Streaked Mountain
Road.” Of the signs I have seen so far, this ranks highly in the
“inauspicious” column. And it was a difficult climb. I find out later it is
about 2.7 times smaller than the Kancamagus — but that it is more steep. The
bike can handle it.

I spend the night with friends of friends, who have built a beautiful log cabin
in Bridgton, Maine, and have lived there for many years. We eat delicious tomato
vegetable soup and watch part of a film in their cellar movie theater, complete
with surround sound and projector. The movie’s about the 1976 Tangshan earthquake,
which, during a period of something like 15 seconds, caused such destruction
that an estimated 255,000 people died. The next morning I pack the bike and head
toward Conway.

A sign on 112, the Kancamagus highway, reads “No gas for 20 miles.” The
implication is: you’ll need plenty of it for this road. West of Conway, for 20
miles, the road climbs steadily, then sharply, rising 2,500 feet to a peak of
2,855. There is a bicycle race up and down it called “Crank the Kanc.” A few
other bicyclists are out today, chugging and moving quickly on sleek bikes.
Those headed down hug the center line and push 40.

I have brought gas for the Kanc: two jars of peanut butter, beef jerky, an
avocado, an orange, sourdough bread, roasted almonds, and dark chocolate. I peel
the avocado and eat it like an apple. I have four bottles of water. I am getting
1600 miles to the gallon of peanut butter.

As the sun approaches its zenith, I approach mine, and at 12:00 I crest the top
of the Kanc and glide down toward the Pemigewasset valley. It has taken three
and a half hours to reach the top.

In the public library at Lincoln, I find in their archives a newspaper from the
early 20th century, back when Lincoln and Woodstock were lumber towns. There is
town gossip, local news, reports of so-and-so’s health, photos of men who worked
for the railroad, standing in the snow. There is lumberjack poetry. One poem is
titled, “I’m Goin’ Back fer Good” and begins:

    Well, Bob, the winter's over an' I'm goin' out fer good,
    I've bin a stickin' here so long that my head is turnin'
      wood.
    For ten long months I've been teamin', an I've staked
      up quite a roll.
    But the woods haint no place fer me Bob, an' I'm gona
      take a stroll.

    [...]

    Here I am in the city, a grand old place at that,
    So different to the forest, like a man is to a rat.
    Everybody busy, like beavers in the wood.
    Oh well I'm in the city, an' I guess I'm here for good.

    How the folks are dessed up. Like Sunday in the
      town.
    I'll have to buy a new rig, cuz I cain't wear rags around
    What's that! Eighty dollars! Holy Pines but what
      a price.
    Well, I spose I'll have to take it, it sure looks clean
      and nice.
    Two months gone to Hell, Boys, fer it took just that
      much pay
    To buy clothes an' all my needs, to rig me out
      this way.
    I'm dressed up slick and dandy, but just the way I
      should;
    Cuz I'm stayin' in the city, an' I'm stayin' here fer
      good.

You can guess where it’s going. The ex-woodsman pines for the days of drinking,
dancing and singing by fires, and destroying trees.

    Say Boss, I'm going' to Licoln, will you ship me up
      today?
    Can't yer see that I'm all ready? I want to go 'right
      away.
    I'm goin' back to the mountains, to clean them of
      their wood,
    Yes I'm goin' back to the forest, an' I'm goin' back
      fer good.
