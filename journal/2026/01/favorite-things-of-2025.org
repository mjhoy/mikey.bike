**1Zpresso ZP6**. My coworkers who are deep coffee nerds convinced me to get rid
of my cheap spice grinder and buy a $300 heavy piece of aluminum to hand-grind
my own beans every morning.

**Arizona**. It was my first time climbing here, east of Phoenix, at a crag
called Homestead. I love the saguaro and the limestone tufas. Feels
significantly different than Utah or Nevada.

Speaking of climbs, **/Bullet the New Sky/** at the New River Gorge: awesome
climb in a beautiful place.

**Claude Code**. I'm on the more skeptical side of using LLMs in software
engineering, but this helped me prototype a complex feature in a way I could not
have done without it.

**Controlled Pod Into Terrain**, a podcast about aviation disasters with a
perfect title. Funny, irreverant, scrappy, smart. They seemed to have stopped,
sadly.

**/Crafting Interpreters/**, a /lovely/ book about building interpreters and
bytecode compilers. Perfect for spending thirty minutes every morning with a cup
of (hand-ground) coffee.

**/Cyberpunk 2077/**, a game that puts an enormous amount of effort into the
setting of Night City. I recommend turning off the minimap and riding a
motorcycle everywhere; you'll start building the map in your head. Keanu Reeves
was excellent.

**Geese, /Getting Killed/**.

**/Listers/**, a movie about competitive birdwatching. Funny and earnest.

**NBA playoffs**. It was good, perhaps, that the Celtics lost early to the
Knicks so I could enjoy the spectacle of the Pacers and Tyrese Haliburton. And
to have it all come crashing down halfway through game 7 of the finals --
incredible drama.

**/Pluribus/**. I like how -- unlike /Severance/ -- there is a simple bluntness
to what's happening, and the mysteries live on the periphery.

**Rumney, New Hampshire**. Truly felt like my third place this year.

**/Survivor/, seasons 1-10**. The early seasons are great in that the players
are not yet "good" at being reality TV stars -- they are not as self-aware as
modern contestants. Even the villians are not /quite/ acting the villian. Most
seasons are long, well-edited set-ups for thin veneers of loyalty to turn to
backstabbing and selfishness, with rare moments of connection and even
sacrifice.
