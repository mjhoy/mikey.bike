The last time I was in an office working with other people was February 7,
2020. I left on a remarkably poorly-timed trip to Spain, and returned sick
with something that knocked me out for a week (my doctor much later would
tell me I almost certainly had Covid). By the time I was feeling better, our
office had switched to mandatory Work From Home.

I've been Work From Home for nearly a year, and I've invested (spiritually,
emotionally, financially) in my work desk quite a bit. Here's where I ended
up.

## The desk

It's a standing desk that moves up and down with a motor. I love it.

It's nothing too fancy. It seems well-built. The raising and lowering
with the touch of a button is illuminating. I have never before had a desk
(standing or not) so _precisely_ at the height that fits me. This is the real
benefit of these desks. To illustrate: when I have my crocs on, instead of
just standing in my socks as usual, I notice, and I will adjust the table
ever so slightly to compensate.

My desk is the [iMovr Lander Lite][lander-lite], 53" wide and 24" deep. It
was a little more expensive than other recommended brands, but was one of the
few desks I could find that was 24" deep while being sufficiently long. Most
desks are 30" deep and I was worried about crowding my space. The other nice
thing about this particular desk: it is incredibly easy to set up.

## Standing mat

My friend had one, wasn't using it, and gave it to me. I have no idea what it
is. It feels like a thicker, sturdier yoga pad. It's very simple and I like
it. I mostly stand in my socks, although occasionally I will put on crocs
(which requires a _slight_ table height adjustment -- yes, that's how
sensitive I am).

## External monitor

I splurged and got the [LG 5K][lg-5k] "UltraFine". I've used marginally
disappointing 4K monitors for a long time, and was impressed when I saw the
5K at a local computer store. It's bright, crisp, and has no visible viewing
angle problems. When I saw it, it was on display next to Apple's $6000 Pro
XDR display. I preferred the LG.

For a while, it did seem to cause kernel panics when plugging and unplugging
my Macbook Pro. That appears to have been fixed with Big Sur. The fact that
it doubles as a USB-C hub cuts down on wire chaos. It also charges my laptop,
all in one cable.

## Camera

I'm on at least an hour of Zoom calls a day. And even though the LG 5K has a
webcam built in which is _much_ better than the potato camera in my Macbook
Pro, it's still a terrible image. It turns out you can pretty easily turn a
mirrorless camera into a webcam with the [Elgato Cam Link 4k][camlink], which
takes the HDMI signal from the camera and converts it to a USB webcam.

The cam link is great. It's tiny, just plugs in and starts working, and has a
little light that indicates when it's going. This helps me remember if I left
the camera on.

Here's my setup:

- [Panasonic S5][s5] with a [Leica M-mount adapter][m-adapter] and a
  [35mm Summicron ASPH v1][summicron] lens
- [Manfrotto "magic arm"][magic-arm] clamped to the desk to hold the camera
- My Macbook charger powering the S5 over USB-C (since the LG 5K powers my
  laptop, the charger is free)
- An HDMI cable from my S5 to the Elgato cam link, which is plugged into the
  LG 5K USB-C hub

35mm is as tight as I'd want, for where the camera is. If I had a 28mm
Summicron (this is the dream), I'd probably use that.

The S5 and Summicron are both _absolutely_ overkill, but I already had them,
so why not. I put the S5 into manual mode, set the focus to about where my
face should be, and use the front dial to change the shutter speed to get the
exposure I want. Turn the camera on to activate the camlink, and turn it off
when I'm done. Lovely image, easy to operate.

## Headphones

I used headphones all the time at the office, now there is no need! If
anything, I want to investigate getting some nice speakers. In the meantime,
my work laptop, which is the Macbook Pro 16", has surprisingly decent
built-in speakers.

On Zoom calls, if I need to talk at any length, I use my Apple earbuds. I
just assume their microphone is marginally better than that in the laptop.

## Light

I have a cheap IKEA lamp pointed at the wall behind the monitor. This helps
reduce the contrast of the bright monitor at night, and helps light my face a
little on video calls.

## Pens

Everyone needs a good pen. I use [these][pens].
