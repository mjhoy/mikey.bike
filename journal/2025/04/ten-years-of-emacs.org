OK, technically it's been [[https://github.com/mjhoy/dotfiles/commit/6d373b03f5cdb59079f743cae5b8c8d7dd420f26][eleven years and change]] since I first checked in my
init file, but who's counting.

When I first tried Emacs I hated it. /Hated/ it! Compared to Vim, just trying to
navigate around felt agonizingly cumbersome: mashing modifier keys, relying so
much on my left pinky, firing off random commands by accident. Vim, with its
modes, values /movement/: a lot of programming is jumping around like crazy and
shuttling text from one place to another. Writing is not the bottleneck.

And yet I had to admit Emacs had two very cool things: [[https://orgmode.org][org-mode]] and [[https://magit.vc][magit]]. I
liked magit because it built a powerful UI on top of git without obscuring the
underlying commands I was used to. (I'm one of those weird people that actually
likes command line =git=.) Similarly, org-mode built something wildly rich on
top of plain text, again without obscuring it too much. Something about the
ethos of all this appealed to me.

Emacs values composability. Building rich systems out of simpler parts. Vim is a
chainsaw; Emacs is a box of LEGOs which can produce a very /dull/ chainsaw, but
also lots of other things. Just watch where you're walking.

So I started using Emacs and never really stopped. It's been with me daily at
work, my IDE for PureScript, Rails, C#, and now Scala. I use it for reading and
writing email, for task tracking, for journaling. There have been periods --
usually when I start a job -- where I switch to a JetBrains IDE or VS Code until
I get my Emacs config up to speed. But the truth is that Emacs can work pretty
well wherever VS Code can now, largely thanks to LSP (and, increasingly,
[[https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/][tree-sitter]]).

I've gone through several iterations of my config. Currently I've switched to
using the newer generation of more composable packages that build on top of
existing Emacs subsystems: [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]], [[https://github.com/minad/corfu][corfu]], [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][vertico]], [[https://github.com/oantolin/orderless][orderless]], [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][embark]]. There
seems to be a movement in the community lately toward smaller, simpler and more
modular packages over comprehensive and monolithic packages like [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]].

I still use org-mode and magit every day.

There is something rewarding in picking a tool, sticking with it, and getting to
know it better over time, whether it's Vim, Emacs, IntelliJ, whatever. I suspect
I'll still be using Emacs in next ten years, although I'm sure my day-to-day use
will look quite a bit different as more and more text and code gets slung
through LLMs. I hope that whatever interface I'm using for this holds to the
principle that the best systems are composed of simple, understandable parts.
